### Clicky Game(The Frozen One edition)


# How the app works
Click game built with React to track clicks and present the user with a score. The game will track each clicked image a user makes. If the same image is clicked twice the game will be reset and user will be prompt with a message stating they lost the game.  They could then click on another image to restart the game. Each correct click increments the users score by 1.
